the adb version on your system is different from the adb version on the android sdk platform-tools
link
it works for me

1 check sys adb version

# adb version
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.39
2 check sdk adb version

# cd /Users/wan-mac/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools
# ./adb version
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.32
3 copy

# sudo cp /Users/wan-mac/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb /usr/local/bin
that's all
